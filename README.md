**BankAccountRegistration** is a console-based application developed as a learning project to understand key Spring Framework concepts like Inversion of Control (IoC), Dependency Injection (DI), Bean Scope, and Bean Lifecycle.

<br>

## Features

- **Account Registration**: A simple process to register a bank account.  
- **Spring Core Concepts**: Demonstrates Spring IoC, DI, Bean Scopes, and Bean Lifecycle methods.

- **IoC (Inversion of Control)**: How the control of objects or portions of a program is transferred to the Spring Framework.  
- **DI (Dependency Injection)**: How Spring manages object dependencies and injects them as needed.  
- **Bean Scopes**: Exploring different bean scopes like Singleton, Prototype, etc.  
- **Bean Lifecycle**: Understanding the creation, initialization, and destruction of beans in Spring.
